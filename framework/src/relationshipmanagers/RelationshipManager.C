   * Param to indicate whether all necessary GeometricRelationshipManagers can be attached during
   * the setup of the mesh. When true (and when running with DistributedMesh) the framework can
   * perform two optimizations:
   *
   * 1) Elements not needed by any ghosting functor can be safely deleted during Mesh::init() prior
   *    to building the EquationSystems object or other MOOSE objects. This may result in
   *    significant memory savings during the setup phase.
   *
   * 2) A late mesh reinitialization can be skipped reducing the overall setup time of the
   *    simulation.
   *
   * When in doubt and to allow for maximum flexibility, developers may choose to return false here
   * to simplify setting up Algebraic and Geometric at the same time.
